# 1st-dApp 
My first web3 fullstack Ethereum Dapp created with Ethersjs 
## [Live Demo](https://1st-dapp.netlify.app/) 
1st-dApp is an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity, this smart contract allow user to add his/her mood to the Ethereum network through our smart contract and check the current mood that was entered last into our smart contract.
This dApp was built with Ethersjs which helped connect our frontend with the our Mood smart-contract which was deployed via remix IDE (Ropsten testnetwork).
This project is part of my Learnweb3.io freshman track.
